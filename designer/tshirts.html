                        		<p>Over the past five years, I have had the opportunity to create t-shirt designs for a couple groups that I have been a part of as well as entering t-shirt design contests for businesses.  The first image shows the four designs that I created or helped to create.  The design in the top left corner, is the very first t-shirt design that I ever created.  Berkshire East is a ski mountain resort in Western Massachusetts that held a t-shirt design contest while I was in college.  This was the design I entered into their contest, and it was eventually selected as the winner.  The designs in the top right and bottom left corners were created for a leadership program that I was a facilitator for during my last two years in college.  These shirts were given to all of the participants and facilitators at the end of the program.  The design in the bottom right hand corner is my most recent and was created for shirts to be sold at CrossFit EXP, my CrossFit box.  The idea behind the design was to utilize a word that started with EXP and create a phrase the represented our community and what you get when you become a member there.  Expand your limits with a barbell became the final design.  The last image was a design I entered into a t-shirt design contest for Power Monkey Fitness, a fitness company led by former Olympians Chad Vaughn and Dave Durante that teaches gymnastics and Olympic Lifting techniques.  They are well known amongst the CrossFit community, a group that utilizes both skill sets daily.</p>
